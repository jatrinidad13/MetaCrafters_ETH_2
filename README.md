# Ethereum Calculator DApp

This is a simple decentralized application (DApp) that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction). The DApp uses MetaMask for wallet management and `ethers.js` to interact with the smart contract.

## Features

- Connect to MetaMask wallet
- Perform addition and subtraction operations using a smart contract
- Display the result of the operation directly on the front-end
- React-based front-end with smart contract interaction
